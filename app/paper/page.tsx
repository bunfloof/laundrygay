            We believe that everyone deserves access to laundry without capitalist exploitation that perpetuate white supremacy and economic inequality. The commodification of basic needs is a weapon of the capitalist system that oppresses the working class and imposes a racial hierarchy. Laundry should be free for the people by the people.

              Ok so csc serviceworks be stealing my money, not fixing machines, ruining and burning clothes, and not giving me refunds. csc serviceworks is a $5 billion dollar corporation, FUCK YOU CAPITALISTS. i fucking hate rich people, especially privileged white people.
              <br />
              <br />
              fucking white people and right wingers always calling the cops on us for no reason. every time i see white people, it makes my blood boil. for those POCs who are still be hanging out with white people, you need to change for the better or be sent to re-education camps, especially yellow striped Vietnamese refugees in the United States. I ain‚Äôt none of that yellow red stripe shit. YOU LOST THE VIETNAM WAR losers that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre here bending down to the US and people like Donald Trump who‚Äôs always talking about fighting China. 60% of the Vietnamese in the United States are BRAINWASHED REPUBLICANS. i fly the red flag with the star, not the yellow flag with 3 red stripes YOU FUCKING REPUBLICANS. i simply don‚Äôt feel comfortable associating with a flag that reeks of right wingers. 
              <br />
              <br />
              So fuck the Vietnamese culture here, it‚Äôs a boba liberalism of Southern Vietnamese‚Äôs misguided belief in the US‚Äôs right-wing, anti-communism propaganda, and the ‚ÄúAmerican Dream.‚Äù Y‚Äôall Vi·ªát ki·ªÅu here act hot shit putting the Vietnamese flag üáªüá≥ in your instagram bios, but you ain‚Äôt a true Viet G. You‚Äôre a fake three striped brainwashed baby born in the United States for entertainment purposes. I bet you monotone asses only understand the southern Vietnamese dialect because that‚Äôs what sore losers like your mother and refugees speak. You ain‚Äôt from the motherland like me. You‚Äôre only from a mother in the United States.
              <br />
              <br />
              so back to my point, white people are not your friends and will never be your friends. i learned that the hard way and i taught my POC friends that too. if you see a white entity, you better take advantage of them before they take advantage of you. white people will serve us. call that reparations for what they‚Äôve done to us for centuries. that‚Äôs exactly what we are gonna do here.

                BrightAI is the company responsible for the cschub software that runs these Internet of Things (IoT) laundry machines. Each laundry machine is equipped with a Raspberry Pi, which is its primary communication interface. Each machine connect to a hub via a WiFi access point (SSID: csc-hub-0000). Each machine is assigned a unique IP address within a local WireGuard virtual private network using the 10.200.0.0/24 subnet.

              Too bad their software developers intentionally doesn‚Äôt follow best security practices. We‚Äôve uploaded our infected payload to the BrightAI API, the hubs download the infected code, and we gain remote root access to all of their hubs and servers. We‚Äôve reverse engineered the cschub binary, developed, and injected our own code into their hubs. We wish we could‚Äôve found their source code earlier from that one intern‚Äôs GitHub account, so we didn‚Äôt have to IDA64 their binary.
